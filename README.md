## ❓ FAQ

<details>
  <summary><strong>🔒 Is it safe to use?</strong></summary>

    Yes, it's completely open-source. There are no token loggers, backdoors, or obfuscation. If you're unsure, feel free to inspect the code or compile it yourself.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>❓ Why is it free?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    I made this addon to help DonutSMP players automate boring tasks without paying ridiculous prices for private clients. It's a free, powerful alternative.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>📦 Can I use this on other servers?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    This addon was made specifically for DonutSMP, and most features are designed to work only there (e.g., Auction Sniper, Auto Sell, RTP Base Finder). While some basic modules may still work elsewhere, the full functionality is best experienced on DonutSMP.
